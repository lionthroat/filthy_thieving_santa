# Filthy Thieving Knapsack
A kleptomaniac's implementation of the 0/1 knapsack problem, using a dynamic programming approach. Rewritten in Go
after being originally coded in C for algorithms coursework.

##### Why did this interest me?
<blockquote>
After Aditya Bhargava's book, Grokking Algorithms, helped me understand the dynamic programming approach to the 0/1 knapsack problem,
my own homework program seemed a little... well, sad. I wanted to know WHICH items were stol--*COUGH*--placed in the knapsack,
and what the nature of this knapsack actually was. Is this a critical part of making the algorithm work? No. Do I care? Also no.
I can't post the original code in C to discourage future students in my program from yoinking it, so I decided to use a program
rarely, if ever, taught in a university setting: Go.
</blockquote>

##### How did Go, well... go?
<blockquote>It's still going, so to speak. I've found getting started with Go to be much rougher than Rust. Where did my ternary
operator go? Why can't I declare an array pointer without knowing the length? What do nil slices have to do with emptying an array?
And for goodness sakes, why won't it just compile with my unused variables while I work on porting my full solution into Go? (Please
don't answer the last question; I know the answer, I just disagree with the decision on every level.)
</blockquote>

##### How could this be improved?
<blockquote>Plz compile I need serotonin :(</blockquote>
